Privacy Policy for Conserve Box

Effective Date: 18-02-2025
Last Updated: 18-02-2025
Conserve Box ("the Plugin") is developed by Conserve Solutions ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle user data in relation to our Plugin available on the Autodesk App Store.

1. Data Collection and Usage
Our Plugin does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information. It operates entirely within Autodesk Revit and does not send data to any external servers.
If the Plugin collects any non-personal usage statistics (such as error logs or analytics), it will be explicitly mentioned within the Plugin settings, and users will have the option to opt out.

2. Third-Party Data Sharing
Since our Plugin does not collect any user data, it does not share any data with third parties, including analytics services, advertising networks, or legal affiliates.
If we ever integrate third-party services in future updates, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly to ensure that any shared data is protected under the same standards.

3. Data Retention and Deletion
As we do not collect user data, there is no data retention policy required. However, if future versions of the Plugin include data collection, we will specify retention periods and offer users options for data deletion.

4. User Consent and Data Deletion Requests
Since no data is collected, users do not need to provide consent, nor do they need to request data deletion. If we implement data collection in the future, we will provide a clear method for users to revoke consent and request deletion.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Users are encouraged to review this page periodically for any updates.
